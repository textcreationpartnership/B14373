            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:176869:6"/>out of the <hi>86. Pſalme,</hi> which by frequent meditation may be caſt into this flame, as fuell to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon why me ought with feruor to honour the B Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, is her Excellency, the which is by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expreſſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Type of the Temple of <hi>Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in theſe words: <hi>Her foundations are in the holy mountaines; our Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the gates of Sion, more then all the Tabernacles of Iacob.</hi> Out of which words, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly inferre, that the first, &amp; leaſt grace that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon the Bl. Virgin in the
<pb facs="tcp:176869:6"/>first moment of her Conception, was greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he greatest that euer any man or Angel receiued.</p>
               <p>They ſay alſo, that our B. Lady did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually increaſe the grace with she had receaued, yea dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the ſame. From whence ſome no leſse piouſly, then probably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, do conclude, That her grace and glory alone, is more perfect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of all the Saints and Bleſsed togeather, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more eſteemed, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God, then all other pure creaturs whatſoeuer. Wherfore if honour &amp; reuerence muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere in proportion vnto the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency; who cannot eaſily gather
<pb facs="tcp:176869:7"/>from hence that our Bleſ. Lady is more to be honored &amp; loued, then all the Bleſsed togeather?</p>
               <p>Caſt now the eye of your Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole world, &amp; conſider euery kingdome, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, Citty, and Village, how greatly, by how many, &amp; in what manner, aſwell priuately as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly the Angells, Apostles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confeſſors, Virgins, and the rest of Bleſsed are honoured; and after that your haue well pondered, and admired the ſame, &amp; making one maſſe of them all, O how great will it ſeeme to be? and verily, if the B. Virgin may lustly challenge vnto herſelfe far
<pb facs="tcp:176869:7"/>greater honour &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then all that; how feruent then, how ready, how enflamed, how many winges of Deuotion ought you to haue, how many heads &amp; hands, to adore and honour her, as you ought? Her, I ſay, whome the B. Trinity ſo much honoureth; how much more ought you (poore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me and abiect Creature) to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</p>
               <p>The Second reaſon, why we should honour and reuerence our B. Lady with feruor is, becauſe she is the Mother of God; the which the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in theſe words: <hi>Glorious thinges haue bene ſayd of
<pb facs="tcp:176869:8"/>thee, O Citty of God.

<pb facs="tcp:176869:8"/>doth she not deſerue at our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ls, who ſo much honoured our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, our Father, &amp; the Loue of our Hart?</p>
               <p>Lastly, the prerogatiue of the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her innumerable merits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all mankind. For when the Sonne of God came to take humane Nature vpon him, then should the world haue receyued him with great reuerence, and ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> armes of Loue, it should haue gone out to haue met, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him with the feruent loue of the Seraphims, with the beauty of the Cherubims, with the variety of the Vertues and Thrones: but
<pb facs="tcp:176869:9"/>ſuch was the blindnes, ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cude and vnworthynes therof, as that it deſpiſed &amp; reiected him, and as much as lay in it, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned that neceſsary, and ſo long deſired worke of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Yet you, O moſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin Mary, you only amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt all the world, enflamed with Charity like the Seraphims, in Wiſdome like the Cherubims, by your Humility &amp; purity did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent your ſelfe a most gratefull Throne vnto Almighty God, and with the fragrant odour of your Vertues, did ſo temper the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauoury ſtench of ſinne, which had made the world ſo abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb facs="tcp:176869:9"/>to the Sonne of God, as that you allured, yea drew him downe from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to earth; most officiouſly le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding your bowels vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, to receiue him, your armes to imbrace him, your tongue to praiſe him, and finally euen your ſelfe wholy to ſerue him perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for them.</p>
               <p>And to omit other merits of the B. Virgin towards men; as alſo her many ſeruices exibited in their behalfe vnto the Sonne of God, let vs weigh what <hi>S.

<pb facs="tcp:176869:10"/>(ſayth he) O Virgin the tydings ſent from heauen (to wit, that you are choſen to be the Mother of God) the Angel expecteth your anſwere, for it is time that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto him that ſent him. And we likwiſe. O Lady, expect a word of commiſeration: for behold the price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is offered vnto you; if you giue your conſent, we shall be forthwith ſet all liberty. This humble ſupplication, O pious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, the dolefull <hi>Adam,</hi> with his miſerable progeny caſt out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, doth prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto you.

<pb facs="tcp:176869:10"/>Patriarches, your Progenitors, who dwell in the region of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; in the shaddow of death. This the whole world prostrate at your feet doth expect. And not without cauſe, ſeeing that vpon your word dependeth the comfort of the miſerable, the redemption of the captiue, the ranſome of thoſe that are condemned, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the health, and welfare of all the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> that are of your stock. Thus <hi>S.

               <pb facs="tcp:176869:11"/>
               <p>The third cauſe that ought to styrre vs vp to Feruor, in honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Bleſ.

The habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in you, is as it were of al reioycing.</hi> Verily <hi>of all;</hi> and why <hi>reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> but for the manifold bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which she dayly heapes vpon vs? In ſo much that I may boldly &amp; truly ſay with <hi>S. Bernard: Let him be ſilent, O B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in the prayſes of your Mercy, whoſoeuer he be, that hauing called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you in his diſtreſſes, can truly ſay, that you haue bin wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:176869:11"/>to helpe him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is none ſuch to be found, therfore let none be ſilent, but all ioy full and feruent; let them honour the Lengh of her Mercies, with a perpetual deuotion; the Breadth with all kind of excellent Prayſes; the Height with moſt diuine worſhip; &amp; the Depth with a moſt profound reuerence.</hi> But of the benefits &amp; Mercyes of our B Lady, we shal ſpeake more afterward.</p>

I ſhould eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue theſe two words, as ſo many darts of loue, to haue ſo pierced the breſt of this mellifluous Doctour, with ſuch ſweetnes and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly delight, that his hart did leape, &amp; the reſt of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy exult with ioy, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of loue. And as the ſoule of the Spouſe did melt at the voyce of her beloued; ſo was his ſoule in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner euen melted when he heard the voice of his beloued Mother. The like teſtimony of loue may you ſecurely expect from the B. Virgin, if in your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

               <p>ANother great argument of piety, and Reuerence towards our B. Lady, is to build Churches, and erect

This exerciſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated otherwiſe in the Mirrour of Examples, &amp; is

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:176869:130"/>ardent affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards the Mother of God, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away with ſo violent a ſtreame of diuine loue, that he had no mind either to thinke or ſpeake of any other thing, then of God and his B.

And his Loue at length came to ſo high a pitch, that one night as he was in prayer, being preſented by the hands of Angels before the face of the Mother of God, by their aduiſe he gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be her Spouſe (after which affiance he tooke the name of <hi>Ioſeph</hi>) and ſhortly after experienced what wonderfull care his
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:176869:131"/>moſt beloued Eſpouſe the V. Mary had of him, not only in matters of great moment, but alſo in euery occaſion, were it neuer ſo little. As for example: Once whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his ſickneſſe he had beene let bloud, he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by our B.

Another time as he was going to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit a Cloyſter of Nuns, the B. Virgin a little before he arriued there, gaue them warning to entertayne him with all courteſy and kind
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:176869:131"/>neſſe. Many more ſuch like examples there be of the loue and care that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, which may be read more at large in the hiſtory of his life, <hi>in Surius the</hi> 5. <hi>April.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That euery morning as ſoone as they are vp and ready, or if they pleaſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are ready to heare maſſe, they ſay the prayer of the Sodality, endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to pronounce it with the ſame intention, deſire,

               <p n="3">3. That at night they examen themſelues concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe two points: firſt about the Prayer which

               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:176869:142"/>
               <p>Whoſoeuer doth earne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly endeauour to put theſe things in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſhall infallibly find that tender affection of the B.

This yong man after that he had prodigally ſpent his patrimony, at length by perſuaſion of an Vncle of his who had heretofore v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all meanes in vaine to bring him to better life, did determine for a remedy, &amp;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:176869:142"/>redreſſe of all his miſeryes to recite euery day for the ſpace of one yeare, a paire of beades, or the third part of the Roſary of our Lady. Neither was this done wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout profit: For now he had already ſhaken of moſt of the ill company he was wont to keep, and he alſo abſtained from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting any grieuous ſinnes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the beginning of the 2. yeare he doubled his deuotions, and dayly ſayd two paire of beads; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the good ſucceſſe which he had therin rayſed vp his hart to a more firme and ſtedfaſt hope of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

For he had no ſooner ended, but the B. Virgin far brighter then the ſunne, vouchſafed him aviſible ſight of her glory, and ſhewed him 3. garments which ſhe carried faſtened to her owne robe; one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, and one vpon ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, and then ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: Behould thy ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

               </head>
               <p>THat manner of ſaluting the B. Virgin is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and famous, which conſiſteth of an hundred &amp; fifty <hi>Aue Maries,</hi> and one <hi>Pater Noster</hi> before euery decade. Neither is that leſſe in vſe, which conſiſteth of 63. <hi>Aue Maries,</hi> according to the number of yeares, which our Bleſſed Lady is thought to haue liued on earth, adioyning to euery Decade, one <hi>Pater Noster.</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:176869:156"/>The firſt of theſe manners, is called the Roſary, both becauſe it is knit together with myſticall Roſes, as <hi>S.

The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is tearmed, the Crown, wherewith, as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the B.

And the Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Minimes</hi> hath greatly propagated the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: although the Crowne it ſelfe is vſually euery where called by the name of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in regard whereof we wil vſe theſe Names confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:176869:156"/>without any regard of diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But the thing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt profit and conſolation is, to recite daily, and offer vnto our B. Lady the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or Crowne; the which oblation, that it may be done with more fruit and guſt, it is expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſeaſon the ſame with diuers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which are found euery where, in deuout bookes: and heere we will propound three only, as it were fountaines of the reſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt manner of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Roſary, is that, wherin chiefeſt regard is had of attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:176869:157"/>with ſome application of the ſenſe to the ſame; which is very eaſy, if with diſcretion the Rules fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing be obſerued.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before you begin, recollect your ſelfe a little, marking with attention how Noble and Angelicall an Office you are about to performe, and for what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Bleſſing your ſelfe with the ſigne of the croſſe, begin, with ſaying one of theſe Verſicles, or the like.

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Then recite the firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade or Ten, pondering the Conſideration next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyng. This being duely performed, ſay: O mother of God, and Virgin Mary, let all the holy Angells ten thouſand tymes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll and bleſſe you. The ſecond decade with the Conſideration being alſo ended, ſay: Let all holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches &amp; Prophets twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand tymes extoll and bleſſe you. After the third ſay: Let all holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fifth: Let all holy Confeſſours fifty thouſand tymes &amp;c. After the ſixth: Let all holy Virgins, wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and others, bleſſe and extoll you a hundred thouſand tymes.</p>
               <p>Then reciting the three laſt <hi>Aue Maries;</hi> in the firſt you ſhall ſalute the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary, daughter of the Eternall Father, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vertue of Fayth, &amp; offering your body to her perpetuall ſeruice. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond you ſhall ſalute the B.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:176869:158"/>Virgin Mary, Mother of the Sonne of God, asking the vertue of Hope, &amp; offering your ſoule vnto her. In the third you ſhall ſalute the Virgin Mary, Spouſe of the Holy Ghoſt, crauing the vertue of Charity, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto her whatſoeuer you haue, or by any iuſt title can lay claime vnto: &amp; after this conclude by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creed deuoutly.</p>
               <p>When you haue thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Roſary, you may recite the Hymne <hi>Aue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris stella,</hi> with the verſicle, and Prayer. Diuers do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the Pſalme <hi>De profundis</hi> for the dead; Or, <hi>Laudate

               <p>And that you may recite the ſayd Office, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deuotion and benefit, theſe few thinges you are carefully to practiſe. Firſt, recollect your ſelfe a little before the ſaying of euery Houre, as hath beene ſayd touching the Roſary: next

               <p>AFter you haue made vſe of the former two Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, you muſt apply your ſelfe to the practiſe, in
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:176869:212"/>which do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly occurre the greateſt difficulties. For perfection is not ſo eaſily obteyned as deſired, &amp; that for diuers cauſes, but chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly, and moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the exerciſe of Vertue is begun confuſedly, and without method, or order; or els, becauſe we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more at once then we can well, and ſolidely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; wherby it eaſily falleth from vs, &amp; we ſoone looſe it agayne. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by an orderly and diligent examine, which is the third Help to the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the B. Virgin, and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:176869:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>conſiſteth chiefly in theſe two things: Firſt in the well compoſing and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the matter was take in hand; ſecondly in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant keeping of the time in which it is to be put in practiſe.</p>
               <p>The matter of this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine may be ſayd to be twofold. The firſt may be about thoſe actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ours in which we ſtriue to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the B. Virgin, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ech one particularly &amp; orderly, by themſelues; as for example: In ſeeking to make our meditation in ſome ſort like vnto that of the V. Virgin; in ſome ſort
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:176869:213"/>I ſay, for ſo much perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as was in her, euen the Seraphims neuer attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto. Or elſe, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring to imitate her deuotion, in hearing of Maſſe, Hand labour, or any other corporall Exerciſe; &amp; ſo likewiſe in any other thing.</p>
               <p>The other may be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vertues of the B. Virgin, which in their degrees we are to labour to attayne vnto. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in making a particular examine of Humility, we are to begin with ſome one of her actions, &amp; ſo go on by degrees vnto the reſt.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:176869:213"/>And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue in ſome ſort profited our ſelues in Humility, we may paſſe, (obſeruing the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod) vnto other vertues, as fraternall Charity, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſo vnto the reſt; in ſuch ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner neuertheles, that we may chiefly inſiſt vpon thoſe which we find moſt vſefull, and neceſſary for our ſelues.</p>
               <p>To this Examine three ſeuerall tymes belong. The firſt is the morning, when we muſt obſerue 3. things. 1. To make a reſolution &amp; conceiue an earneſt deſire of imitating the B. Virgin in ſuch or ſuch an action or
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:176869:214"/>vertue. 2. That we take ſom ſigne of remembrance, to put vs in mynd at certaine tymes to renew our good purpoſes. For example, ſome ſhort ſentence, or ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatory praiet, or the ſight of ſome Image, or as often as we hear the clock ſtrike, or els whenſoeuer we ſhall go out of our chamber, or the like. The 3. is to begge humbly of the diuin good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, we may keep this our our purpoſe &amp; reſolution.</p>
               <p>The ſecond tyme is at noone whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we muſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, 1. Whether we haue performed our morning-purpoſe. 2. Whether we
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:176869:214"/>haue made vſe of the ſigne of remembrance, which we tooke; &amp; whether we haue noted our defects, or the profit we haue made, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring day by day, week by week, &amp; month by month. 3. We are to conceiue a new purpoſe for the tyme to come, in confidence of the help of God, and his moſt B. Mother, whoſe ayd we are agayne humbly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore.</p>
               <p>The 3. tyme is the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when we are to make our Examine, in the ſame manner as we did before at Noone.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it helpeth
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:176869:215"/>very much towards the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant performing of our good purpoſes, to call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> often to mynd, therfore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers haue vſed ſundry mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; ſpeciall helps therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>S. Hedwigis</hi> a <hi>Polonian</hi> Ducheſſe, did vſe ſtill to weare about her necke an Image of the B.

Which her piety was afterwards made notable by a famous miracle. For at her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of this life, ſhe held
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:176869:215"/>the ſayd Image ſo faſt with three fingers of her left hand, that it could by no meanes, or force be taken thence, and ſo was buryed with her. After 25. yeares her body being to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to another place, was found all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed to duſt, except thoſe three fingers which held ſtill the Image of our B. Lady, &amp; her head, which was not only found, whole &amp; vncorrupted, but alſo full of a moſt fragrant odour, which like oyle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled from thence, in great aboundance. <hi>[Sur. in eius vita. 15.

               <p>And firſt you ſhall ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne your ſelfe to be in a threefold ſtate. 1. As one ſicke and wounded (for ſo indeed ſpiritually you are, through your ſinnes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled paſſions, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections,) ſo as
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:176869:220"/>from head to foot there is no ſound part in you. 2. As one poore, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme want of all vertues, merits, and diuine graces. 3.

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:176869:225"/>1. How to frame vnto our ſelues a patterne of thoſe actions principally, in the which the B. Virgin was moſt conuerſant. 2. How to make a Catalogue of ſuch principal Vertues which ſhe chiefly exerciſed.</p>
               <p>The firſt of her Actions, was prayer and meditation of heauenly things. For ſo [<hi>in Med. vitae Christi c.</hi> 3.] ſayth <hi>S.

Whoſoeuer therfor deſyreth to imitae our B.
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:176869:245"/>Ladyes moſt holy Example in often frequenting the Holy Communion (yet by the ſpeciall direction of his Ghoſtly Father) let him haue a ſpeciall care of that due preparation, purity, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, charity, and other Vertues, which ſhe dayly practiſed, &amp; diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, let it be your chiefeſt care to make that conſideration very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar vnto you (eſpecially the day before you are to communicate, or els the ſame morning) which F. <hi>Robert Southwell</hi> of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Ieus (famous for
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:176869:245"/>his conſtant ſuffering for the Catholique Cauſe in England) did dayly vſe with great guſt of mynd, and no leſſe fruite of Spirit, and which he hath left written with his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, in theſe words. If (ſayth he) the B.

What continuall actes of loue, do you thinke, would ſhe make? How carefully wold ſhe prepare the chamber of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:176869:246"/>her heart to receaue him? with how many tears, with what ſighs with what arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prayers would ſhe expect that day and houre? And when ſhe knew the tyme to be at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how humbly, how deuoutly, how reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, would ſhe prepare herſelfe for the entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him? She would no doubt ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that tyme who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the contemplation of God, and conſideration his infinite Goodnes, Loue, Mercy and Maieſty; in ſuch manner, that euen enflamed with the fire of Charity, ſhe would now become more diuine then humane; &amp; for

So wryteth Fa. <hi>Southwell,</hi> concerning a more remote preparation.</p>
               <p>But now in the tyme of that Maſſe wherat you are to receaue, you muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelfe in another manner; by ſtyrring vp in your ſelfe actes of Fayth, Humility, Confuſion, and Sorrow for your ſinnes, with theſe, or the like ſhort Aſpirations; O how fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, how intent were thoſe actes of Fayth which the B,

They were euen as great as that which ſhe exerciſed, in belieuing the Angell Gabriell; announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ſo admirable, and incomprehenſible Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Conception of the Sonne of God! Or as that, wherewith ſhe belieued, and adored him as true God, moſt wiſe, moſt Powerfull, moſt Holy, of an infinite Maieſty, Perfection, and Glory, euen when ſhe ſaw him hanging naked on the Croſſe, expoſed to iniuries and ſcornes of men, and laſt of all dying an infamous
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:176869:247"/>death! With this light of Fayth how profundly did ſhe enter into herſelfe, and how lowly did ſhe humble herſelfe before the diuine Maieſty! ſhe I ſay, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected the Mother of God, yet reputed, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led herſelfe his Handmayd? and who among the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and diſciples when they were gathered togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expecting the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Holy Ghoſt, had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced herſelfe in the loweſt ranke among them? Do you ſtriue to imitate as neer as you can this humility &amp; fayth of the B. Virgin, and falling downe before the

Who had giuen thoſe ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and feet, to be cruelly boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through? That breaſt to be pierced with a lance, which was yet more deeply wounded with loue? And laſtly, who had giuen all his whole body, to be moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

               <p>YOu may learne out of S. Ambroſe, what the repoſe of our B. Lady was. The B. Virgin (ſayth he l. 2. <hi>de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irg.</hi>) had ſooner
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:176869:267"/>neceſſity the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſire to ſleep and yet, whileſt her body did reſt, her ſoule was ſtill watchfull, often repeating in her ſleepe what ſhe had read; or interrupted of her reſt, ſhe continued ſtill the ſame. To which may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of <hi>S. Bernard,</hi> that whilſt the B. Virgin ſlept, by a meritorious act, ſhe did wholy aſpire vnto God &amp; was euen then a perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templant. <hi>[ſerm. 51. c. 2.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which ſanctity of hers euen in ſleeping you are to imitate, as neere as you can. To the attaining wherof a continuall deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exerciſe of vertue
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:176869:268"/>wil wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully help. Beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the B. Virgin doth vſe to beſtow her benediction v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thoſe who take their reſt in decent &amp; holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as <hi>S. Dominicke</hi> did ſee her once ſprinkle with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water, and bleſſe all his Religious being a ſleepe, excepting one, who lay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decently in his bed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were ignorant thereof.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Of the Imitation of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Vertues of the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: &amp; first of her Purity.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THat the B. Virgins Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was neuer ſo much as blemiſhed, with the leaſt ſpot of ſin, S. Baſil in one word doth ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare when he ſayth: That among all Creatures liuing there was not any greater nor the like Purity to be found then that of the Bl. Virgin. <hi>[in orat. de hum. Christi gener.]</hi> And S. Anſelme ſayth: The pure Sanctity, and moſt ſaintly
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:176869:269"/>Purity of her pious breaſt, did infinitly ſurpaſſe the purity of all other creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res whatſoeuer. <hi>(de Excell. B. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin. c. 9.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this purity the B. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin did accompany it with two other Vertues, to wit, the continuall Preſence of God, and as carefull Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of her ſelfe. Of the preſence of God, Caniſius doth thus diſcourſe. What is more happy then the B. Virgin, who whitherſoeuer ſhe went, did alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Euerlaſting Diuinity of God adoring inwardly ſo great a Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:176869:269"/>in ſpirit and truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing nothing in that her ſo pure and holy breaſt but what was alſo moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and pure. <hi>(lib. 1. c. 13.)</hi> Of her euer watchful care to keep this Purity, the B. Virgin herſelfe ſayd thus vnto S. Brigit. Euen from that tyme (ſayd ſhe) that I firſt vnderſtood there was a God, I was alwayes fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſolicitous of my ſelfe, &amp; of my obſeruance towards him, inwardly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, and euery houre fearing leaſt by word, or deed, I might any wayes offend him. <hi>[lib. de reuel. cap. 10.]</hi>

                  <p>NOw that you may not only know this Purity but that knowing it, may alſo loue it, &amp; that louing it, may likewiſe deſyre and imbrace it, you muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repreſent vnto your ſelfe the moſt admirable purity of the B. Virgin as moſt reſplendant, fayre, louely and gratefull both to God, Angels, and Men. She appeared once to <hi>S. Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trude,</hi> like to a moſt white &amp; ſhining Lilly, ſpreading it ſelf before the moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Indiuidual Trinity:
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:176869:270"/>at what tyme the B. Virgin likewiſe taught her the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Salutation, as moſt gratful vnto herſelf. Hayle O white Lilly of the euer reſplendant, and peaceable Trinity. Haile o faire Roſe of the celeſtiall Delights, of whoſe Roote, the king of heauen vouchſafed to be borne, &amp; of whoſe milk he would be fed, therby to nouriſh our ſoules with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Influence. <hi>[lib. 3. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. diuin. c. 19.]</hi> Euen ſo when you ſhall behold any Image of our B. Lady, as if you perceaued ſome liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purity therein ſay; O B. Mary, more fayre then the
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:176869:271"/>ſun by thy purity, &amp; in ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Another tyme the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin appeared to <hi>S.

                  <p>TO the practiſe of this Purity, a particuler Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine is very neceſſary to be made, at a certaine tyme and place, as neere as may be, obſeruing theſe two ſpeciall points. 1. To Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your greater ſinnes,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:176869:272"/>if by chante you haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into any, making a firme purpoſe by the grace of God vtterly to forſake them. 2.

                     <pb n="511" facs="tcp:176869:272"/>on Pilgrimage, burdened with a number of ſinnes, and of a life moſt impure was twice frighted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the ſacred Houſe by certayne terrible viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which the ſaw before him at the dore; nor was he able by any means to enter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had byn at confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and receaued abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſinnes. <hi>[Turſell. in hist.

                  <p>The like happened vnto <hi>S. Mary</hi> of Aegypt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a grieuous ſinner, who was hindred by a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall force from entring into the Holy Sepulcher of our Lord at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi>

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:176869:273"/>greatly diſpleaſing to the B. Virgin.</p>

<pb n="534" facs="tcp:176869:284"/>that ſhe was alone co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with that which did only ſeeme inough vnto her, to the only neceſſary ſuſtenance of her life. <hi>(.10 Reuel. cap. 10. and 3. cap. 8.)</hi> And <hi>Richelius</hi> (cited by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius lib. 1. cap. 10.)</hi> teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame, when he ſaith that the B. virgin after her Sonne was glorifyed and aſcended into heauen, did ſo conforme her ſelfe with his new glory, that the world grew daily more and more vile in her ſight and eſteeme, ſhe thirſting inſatiably after celeſtiall things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How truly poore
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:176869:284"/>ſhe was in her temporall eſtate the ſame <hi>S. Brigit</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth thus from the B. Virgins owne mouth. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning (ſayth ſhe) I made a vow in my hart, if ſo it might be acceptable to God, neuer to poſſeſſe any thing in the world. The which our Sauiours poore Natiuity in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the handicraft of <hi>Saint Joſeph,</hi> as alſo her owne hand-labour do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently witneſſe, yea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Aſcenſion of Chriſt into heauen, ſhe liued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the poore and Euangelicall widowes of the Iewes, with whome ſhe receaued her
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:176869:285"/>almes, out of the common Charity of others, with great ſimplicity, and ioy of hart. And although it be not improbable, that the B Virgin whe ſhe fled with her little ſonne IESVS into Aegipt did liue by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of others, and did aske almes from place to place: Neuertheleſſe diuers graue Authors are of opinion, that afterwards ſhe liued not ſo, it being an vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent thing that ſo moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chaſt a Matrone ſhould ſo offer frequent the houſes and conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others, or that ſo great a louer of priuacy,

And the like alſo in her Chamber, of which the Archangel <hi>Gabriell</hi> had the charge, as teſtifieth <hi>Guarinus</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, how much the B.

               <p>There needs no more to be ſaid; for one only ſigh, one only teare of ſuch as are truly deuoted vnto the B. Virgin, in their neceſſity &amp; affliction, doth beyond all imagination ſo ſtir vp her motherly pitty &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
